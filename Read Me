# Linked List in C++

Linked List implementation in C++

LinkedList.cpp is a simple implementation of Linked List in C++. I have refered various resources to make the different methods of the Linked List.
Following are the methods implemented

1. isEmpty() : method returns true if the list is empty

2. getHead() : returns head node

3. addToStart(): method to add a node at starting

4. addToEnd() : method to add a node at the end

5. display() : method to display all the elements of the Linked List

6. length() : method that returns the length of the Linked List

7. insert() : method to insert element at a given position in the Linked List

8. deletePosition() : method to delete a element at a given position

9. deleteData() : method to delete a data element

10. findMin() : method that returns the max element

11. findMax() : method that returns the min element

12. countOccurences() : method that returns the occurences of an element

13. pop() : pop method removes last element of the Linked List

14. tostring() : method that returns a string of all elements of the String

15. copy() :  method that returns the copy of the list

16. clear() : method that clears the Linked List

17. reverse() : method that returns reversed linked list

18. recursiveReverse() : method that recursively reverses the Linked List

19. indexOf() : method that returns index of a particular element

20. atIndex() : method that returns element at a particular position

If you think you have a better implementation for any method or if you have any doubts or if you want some method implementations please feel free to comment.
